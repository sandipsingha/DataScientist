Hi,

I am Sandip Singha , an IT resource having 15 years of experience in this filed.  My  IT experiences are  in different technologies like oracle, teradata, cognos, erwin data modeling tool etc. I am working with IBM India.

My mother, wife , daughter are dependent on me. My daughter is in class 7 and there is a huge educational expense too. My mother is 66 years old. There is a regular medical expenses too.

I have a home loan for tanure of 10 years and I have to pay INR 12000/- Monthly . Hence taking another loan is not possible for me. At the same time I am very mush excited doing the Data Science Specialization course from your university.

There are so many suggestions, so much material, so many options, it becomes difficult to know what to learn first. There’s a mountain of content, and it’s difficult to know where to find the gold nuggets, the things to learn that will bring you the high return on time investment.

And that’s the crux of the problem. The fact is, time is limited. Learning a new programming language is a large investment of time, so I need to be strategic about which one I select.

To be clear, some languages will yield a very high return on my investment (your investment of both time and money). Other languages are purely auxiliary tools that I might use only a few times per year. 

I I want to learn data science.  Hence it would be great if I get a financial aid.

R programming is one of the cutting age technology  now a days. I think if I learn it it would give me enough boosting in my career. I am very mush excited doing the Data Science Specialization course from your university.
