Course 2:R Programming --> Just started

Roger D. Peng is an Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a Co-Editor of the Simply Statistics blog. 
He conducts research in the areas of air pollution, climate change, and health risk assessment and statistical methods for spatial and temporal data. He created the course Statistical Programming at Johns Hopkins where it has been taught for the past 8 years. He is also a national leader in the area of methods and standards for reproducible research and is the Reproducible Research editor for the journal Biostatistics. 

Course Description
------------------

In this course you will learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. You will learn how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment, discuss generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis and optimization will provide working examples.

    Week 1: Overview of R, R data types and objects, reading and writing data
    Week 2: Control structures, functions, scoping rules, dates and times
    Week 3: Loop functions, debugging tools
    Week 4: Simulation, code profiling
